# py_lamda_quiz
Backend lambda code for an Alexa skill quiz.

This was written as part of the promotion with Amazon to get a free hoodie if you submitted an Alexa skill to the Skills shop.
It was not ever intended to be a professional robust application.

TODO
Abstract out the references to flags to make the quiz backend generic
Abstract out the variation in Alexa responses to a separate file
Add a menu state with multiple quiz sub-options
